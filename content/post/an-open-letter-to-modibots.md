Dear Modibots,

On the Internet, spammers are considered the scum of humanity. By indiscriminately spamming people's inboxes, you are only giving credence to the idea that you are a bunch of obnoxiously ignorant boisterous knuckle-dragging sheeple who do not belong in the civilized world, let alone the Internet.

Best wishes,
