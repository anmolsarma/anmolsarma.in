A critical look at Khurshed Batliwala’s talk, “Technology of Spirituality” delivered at Ruia College, Mumbai.

Mr. Batliwala makes a number of extraordinary claims about the state of ancient Indian science and technology. Most of them however, turn out to be exaggerations, misinterpretations or outright fabrications. He then attributes all scientific progress to ‘spirituality’.

The talk is nothing more than a sales pitch for Mr. Mr. Ravi Shankar’s ‘Art of Living Foundation’.
