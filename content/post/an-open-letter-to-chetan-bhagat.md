Dear Mr. Chetan Bhagat,

I have never been a fan of your cutesy novels targeted at clueless young adults. However, I am extremely disturbed by your attempts to 'enlighten' your readership by projecting your partisan views as the neutral and objective voice of reason.

The major chunk of your fan base is made up of people who have little to no understanding of political issues and they tend to treat your half assed political ramblings as gospel. As undeserved as it may be, you wield considerable influence over a certain niche of the Indian youth. I urge you to use this power responsibly for the greater good and stop propping up disgraced politicos with a vested interest in perpetuating the status quo.

You frequently talk about systemic change and revolution, it is about time you walked the talk.

Best Wishes,
