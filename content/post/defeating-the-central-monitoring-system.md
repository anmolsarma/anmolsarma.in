The Government of India has rolled out the [Central Monitoring System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Monitoring_System) which will allow it to access any piece of data passing through an Indian service provider. This means the government can now read all your text messages, emails and call records.

Because *privacy* does not bring in votes, it is highly unlikely that any political party will oppose this system. Circumventing this system however, is rather simple using [PGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) or any other *munition grade* cryptographic scheme. So, if anyone wishes to communicate with me securely, please encrypt your message using this [key](http://serverfault.com/questions/471412/gpg-gen-key-hangs-at-gaining-enough-entropy-on-centos-6), whose fingerprint should be:

	FAD8 0050 02CA 5412 A34B  C40D 6DBD 3D52 56AE 35C1 

You may now put your tin-foil hat back on. Thank you!

Edit: Replaced my old key with a 4096-bit RSA key.
