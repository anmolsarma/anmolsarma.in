Here it goes again: After a couple of attempts with Blogger, a dozen iterations with WordPress, a very brief tryst with Drupal and a false start with Bloggart, I’ve now decided to ditch dynamic content management systems and give Octopress a spin.

I like the idea of a statically generated site I can deploy anywhere. I used Sphinx for a documentation once and the experience with was pretty good. However, getting Sphinx to work for a personal blog seemed to be too much work, so Octopress it is. So far I’m really happy with Octopress and with minimal tweaking, I have all the functionality I need. Hopefully, I will stick with it and actually blog this time around. Fingers crossed!
