Dear Miss Khobragade,

The government and the people of India were on your side when the issues were international law and diplomatic protocol. Now that you are back in India, you are requested to stop playing the martyr. You see, nobody gives a rodent's posterior if you cannot visit your sons should they choose to study and work in the US.

Best wishes,
