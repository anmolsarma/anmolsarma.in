Gave an introductory talk on Linux at [Koneru Lakshmiah University](http://www.kluniversity.in/), with [Vamsi](http://www.elitenewb.wordpress.com/)following up with a talk on Bugs and Hacks as a part of the ‘workshop’ organised by the KLU Linux Users Group. With about 150 newbish students in attendance, it was fun albeit in a masochistic kind of a way.

Here’s a shitty picture from the talk, courtesy of Vamsi:
